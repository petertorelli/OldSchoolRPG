# Introduction
Every winter since 1983 I get the urge to play an olde-timey RPG like Wizardry or Bard's Tale.
Playing the original Apple //e exposes some of the main design flaws of the UI, so I thought
it would be fun to hash out the basic game mechanics. Plus, it is a great way to blow off 
steam when my current job is stressing me out.

Basic level editor is up and running (except for one-way passages and spinners). Specific trigger events still need implementation. Two renderers, one that tries to draw an Apple //e like viewport from the original, and another in [threejs](https://threejs.org). Character editing is underway... I'm not focusing on non-20x20 grids yet, there are bugs in there.

Here's a screenshot showing the party, view frustum, darkness, teleporting, doors, secret doors, one way doors, stairs up and down, and a little bitty 3D port all apple-colored...

The map is level 1 of the classic [Wizardry I: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord).
