# Introduction
Every winter since 1983 I get the urge to play an olde-timey RPG like Wizardry or Bard's Tale.
Playing the original Apple //e exposes some of the main design flaws of the UI, so I thought
it would be fun to hash out the basic game mechanics. First, a level editor. Next, a renderer.
Then, dynamic content generation, character tables, etc. Don't know if I'll ever finish, but
feel free to help out.
