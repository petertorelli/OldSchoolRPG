# Introduction
Every winter since 1983 I get the urge to play an olde-timey RPG like Wizardry or Bard's Tale.
Playing the original Apple //e exposes some of the main design flaws of the UI, so I thought
it would be fun to hash out the basic game mechanics. Plus, it is a great way to blow off

First, a level editor. Next, a renderer. Then, dynamic content generation, character tables, etc. Don't know if I'll ever finish, but
feel free to help out.

Here's a screenshot showing the party, view frustum, darkness, teleporting, doors, secret doors, one way doors, stairs up and down, and a little bitty 3D port all apple-colored...
